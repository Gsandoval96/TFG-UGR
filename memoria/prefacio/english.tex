\noindent{\textbf{Abstract:}}\\

In 1980 \textit{Rogue} was published, the father of \textit{rogue-like} games and the forerunner of what we know today as procedural content generation.  These techniques have been applied in many fields but especially in the video game industry.  In order to learn about procedural generation, we will make an introduction to it by first understanding what it is and where it is used, and then we will go into the taxonomies proposed to classify both the content and the methods used to generate it. We will also look at the desirable properties of these algorithms and see how they have been used over the years in the video game industry.\\

On the other hand, this project aims to re-implement the classic video game \textit{Pac-Man} by applying procedural generation to the creation of mazes, generating both the layout of the mazes and the textures of the walls.  For the generation of the maze, an algorithm based on pseudo-random number generators and \textit{Tetris}-style pieces has been implemented to compose the maze. For the textures, a shader based on \textit{Voronoi Tessellation} has been implemented.  This was coupled with the challenge of using a graphics library called \textit{Three.js} instead of a game engine.\\

The project has been successful as the generated mazes meet almost all the desirable properties for procedural content generation methods, generating a wide range of valid and playable mazes quickly that could have been designed by a person.
